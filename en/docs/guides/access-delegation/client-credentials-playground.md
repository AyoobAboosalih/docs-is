# Client Credentials Grant with OAuth 2.0 Playground

This page guides you through using a sample Playground application to try out authentication to an OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect web application using the [Client Credentials]({{base_path}}/references/concepts/authorization/client-credential-grant/) grant type.

----

## Set up the sample application

## Try Client Credentials grant 

1.  Enter the following details.

    - **Authorization Grant Type**: Client Credentials
    
    - **Client ID**: The OAuth Client Key received when registering the service provider.

	- **Client Secret**: The Client Secret received when registering the service provider.

	- **Access Token Endpoint**: `https://<IS_HOST>:<IS_PORT>/oauth2/token`

2. Click **Authorize**. 

	The playground application will send an
	[authorization request](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749#section-4.1.1)
	to the **authorize** endpoint of the WSO2 Identity Server using the
	following format.
	
	!!! abstract ""
        **Request Format**
		```java
		POST
		https://<host>:<port>/oauth2/token
		Authorization: Basic [Base64encode(Client-ID>:<ClientSecret>)]
		Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

		grant_type=client_credentials
		```
		---
        **Sample Request**
		```java
		POST
		https://localhost:9443/oauth2/token
		Authorization: Basic Q3g0TEtGTk9iZXVYb2N4N3hnT3B6NXZmekZvYTogVWRUNm5XbnFXWkdnNDFHWnI5TXBTWGs5eU04YQ==
		Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

		grant_type=client_credentials
		```

3. Log in with user credentials (e.g., `admin`/`admin`). At this point, the application receives the access token. 

4. Enter the **Introspection Endpoint** (i.e, `https://<IS_HOST>:<IS_PORT>/oauth2/introspect`) and click **Get TokenInfo** to get the token   information. 

5. Now you should be able to see the access token information as seen
    below, as long as the provided access token is valid.

!!! note
    
    WSO2 Identity Server provides more control over issuing id tokens and
    user claims for client-credential grant type. To facilitate this, add the following configurations to the `deployment.toml` file found in the `<IS_HOME>/repository/conf` folder in order 
    to register new `         ScopeHandlers        ` and
    `         ScopeValidators        ` .
    
    ``` toml
    [oauth.custom_scope_validator]
    class = "org.fully.qualified.class.name.CustomScopeValidator"
    ```
    
    Further, by configuring the `         <IdTokenAllowed>        ` property
    to `         true        ` or `         false        ` along with the
    above configuration, you can turn on or turn off the process of issuing
    ID tokens for the grant types that have the `         openid        `
    scope. By default, `         IdTokenAllowed        ` is set to
    `         true        `, you can allow it to issue
    `         id_tokens        ` for all grant types that have the
    `         openid        ` scope. By configuring it to false, you can
    stop issuing ID tokens.  
    **Note:** You can not turn off the process of issuing ID tokens for the
    `         authorization_code        ` grant type.
    
    By configuring the `         <IsRefreshTokenAllowed>        ` property
    to `         true        ` or `         false        ` along with the
    above configuration, you can turn on or turn on the process of issuing
    refresh tokens. By default, `         IsRefreshTokenAllowed        ` is
    set to `         true        `, and `        ` you can allow it to
    issue refresh tokens for all grant types. By configuring it to
    `         false        `, you can stop issuing refresh tokens.  
    **Note:** By default, issuing ID token for
    `         client_credentials        ` grant type is disabled as it is
    logically invalid.
