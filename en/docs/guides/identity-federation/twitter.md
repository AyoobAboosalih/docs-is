## Configure the service provider

{! fragments/register-a-service-provider.md !}

5.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** and the **SAML2
    Web SSO Configuration**, and click **Configure**.
6.  In the form that appears, fill out the following configuration
    details required for single sign-on. For more details about
    attributes in the following configuration refer [SAML2 Web SSO Configuration]({{base_path}}/guides/login/webapp-saml/)
   .  
    See the following table for details.

    <table>
    <thead>
    <tr class="header">

    <td>This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected to after the authentication is successful. This is the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL of the service provider. The identity provider redirects the SAML2 response to this ACS URL. However, if the SAML2 request is signed and SAML2 request contains the ACS URL, the Identity Server will honor the ACS URL of the SAML2 request.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>NameID Format</td>
    <td>The default value can be used here.</td>
    <td>This defines the name identifier formats supported by the identity provider. The service provider and identity provider usually communicate with each other regarding a specific subject. That subject should be identified through a Name-Identifier (NameID), which should be in some format so that it is easy for the other party to identify it based on the format. Name identifiers are used to provide information regarding a user.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="even">
    <td>Certificate Alias</td>
    <td>wso2carbon</td>
    <td>Select the <strong>Certificate Alias</strong> from the drop-down. This is used to validate the signature of SAML2 requests and is used to generate encryption.

    <td>Selected</td>
    <td>Select <strong>Enable Attribute Profile</strong> to enable this and add a claim by entering the claim link and clicking the <strong>Add Claim</strong> button. The Identity Server provides support for a basic attribute profile where the identity provider can include the user’s attributes in the SAML Assertions as part of the attribute statement.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Include Attributes in the Response Always</td>
    <td>Selected</td>
    <td>Once you select the checkbox to <strong>Include Attributes in the Response Always</strong> , the identity provider always includes the attribute values related to the selected claims in the SAML attribute statement.</td>

## Try it out

You have successfully configured Twitter as your federated authenticator. Now, when you try to login to your application, it should redirect to the Twitter login page. On successful authentication with your Twitter credentials, you will be able to access your application. 

### Set up the sample app

- Download Apache Tomcat 8.x from
[here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and install. Tomcat
server installation location will be referred as `<TOMCAT_HOME>` later
in this guide.      

- It is recommended that you use a hostname that is not
`          localhost         ` to avoid browser errors. Modify the
`          /etc/hosts         ` entry in your machine to reflect this.
Note that `          wso2is.local         ` is used in
this documentation as an example, but you must modify this when
configuring the authenticators or connectors with this sample
application.

- Download the sample from GitHub.
    1. Navigate to [WSO2 Identity Server Samples](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases).
    2. [Download](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases/download/v4.3.0/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com.war) the `saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com.war` file from the latest release assets.

### Configure CORS

{!fragments/cors-config.md!}

### Deploy the sample app

2.  Start the Tomcat server.

### Log in

1.  Access the Pickup sample application URL:
    `http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com`
