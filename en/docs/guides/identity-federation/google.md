5.  Expand the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** and the **SAML2
    Web SSO Configuration**, and click **Configure**.
6.  In the form that appears, fill out the following configuration
    details required for single sign-on. 
    
    !!! info
        For more details about attributes in the following configuration, refer [SAML2 Web SSO Configuration]({{base_path}}/guides/login/webapp-saml/).  
    
    See the following table for details.

    <td>This is the URL to which the browser should be redirected to after the authentication is successful. This is the Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL of the service provider. The identity provider redirects the SAML2 response to this ACS URL.

    <td>The default value can be used here.</td>
    <td>This defines the name identifier formats supported by the identity provider. The service provider and identity provider usually communicate with each other regarding a specific subject. That subject should be identified through a Name-Identifier (NameID), which should be in some format so that it is easy for the other party to identify it based on the format. Name identifiers are used to provide information regarding a user.</td>
    </tr>

    <td>Certificate Alias</td>
    <td>wso2carbon</td>
    <td>Select the <strong>Certificate Alias</strong> from the drop-down. This is used to validate the signature of SAML2 requests and is used to generate encryption.

    <td>Selected</td>
    <td>Select <strong>Enable Attribute Profile</strong> to enable this and add a claim by entering the claim link and clicking the <strong>Add Claim</strong> button. The Identity Server provides support for a basic attribute profile where the identity provider can include the user’s attributes aof the attribute statement.</td>

    <tr class="odd">
    <td>Include Attributes in the Response Always</td>

## Try it out

You have successfully configured Google as your federated authenticator. Now, when you try to login to your application, it should redirect to the Google login page. On successful authentication with your Google credentials, you will be able to access your application. 

### Set up the sample app

- Download Apache Tomcat 8.x from
[here](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-80.cgi) and install. Tomcat
server installation location will be referred as `<TOMCAT_HOME>` later
in this guide.      

- It is recommended that you use a hostname that is not
`          localhost         ` to avoid browser errors. Modify the
`          /etc/hosts         ` entry in your machine to reflect this.
Note that `          wso2is.local         ` is used in
this documentation as an example, but you must modify this when
configuring the authenticators or connectors with this sample
application.

- Download the sample from GitHub.
    1. Navigate to [WSO2 Identity Server Samples](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases).
    2. [Download](https://github.com/wso2/samples-is/releases/download/v4.3.0/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com.war) the `saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com.war` file from the latest release assets.

### Configure CORS

{!fragments/cors-config.md!}

### Deploy the sample app

Deploy this sample web app on a web container.

1.  Copy the `saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com.war` file into the `<TOMCAT_HOME>/apache-tomcat-<version>/webapps` folder. 

2.  Start the Tomcat server.

### Log in

1.  Access the Pickup sample application URL:
    `http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com`
2.  Click **Login**. You are redirected to the Google login page.
  
    ![Google login page]({{base_path}}/assets/img/samples/sign-in-google.png)
    
3.  Sign in using your Google credentials. You are redirected to the
    Pickup sample homepage.
4.  On a new tab on your browser, access the following URL:
    <https://mail.google.com>.
