# Configure Risk-Based Adaptive Authentication

This guide shows you how to use ELK Analytics to assess an end user's risk score and enable adaptive authentication.

## Scenario
Consider a business use case where a bank wants to prompt an additional authentication step when a user attempts to log in to the system after having made transactions amounting to over $10,000 within five minutes.


The diagram below shows how the connection between the client applications, ELK Analytics, and WSO2 Identity Server
works to assess risk of the user.

1. The user performs bank transactions through different applications.
2. Trnasaction data from all these applications are published to the ELK Analytics via the “transaction” index.
3. The user attempts to access an application that uses WSO2 IS as the identity provider.
4. The application sends an authentication request to WSO2 IS.
5. The user is prompted to log in and WSO2 IS authenticates the user using basic authentication (username/password
   credentials).
6. WSO2 IS publishes an event to ELK, which computes the user's risk score based on the user's transaction history
   using the data received in step 2.
 
      **i.e If the user has made transactions that total to over $10,000 within the last five minutes, the risk score is 1. Else, the risk score is 0.**

7. If the risk score is 1, WSO2 IS prompts an additional step of authentication for the user (i.e. entering a hardware
   key number) before allowing the user to access the service provider application.

## Configure ELK Analytics

ELK has two duties to fulfill in this scenario. Capture the transaction data into an index and calculate the risk score.

1. [Configure]({{base_path}}/deploy/using-elk-analytics-for-adaptive-authentication.md) ELK Analytics for Adaptive Authentication.
2. Run the following command to create an index named `transaction` to store transaction data.

    !!! info
        Replace {ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}, {ELASTICSEARCH_BASIC_AUTH_HEADER} to match your settings

    !!! abstract ""
        **Request Format**
        ``` 
        curl -L -X PUT 'https://{ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}/transaction' -H 'Authorization: Basic {ELASTICSEARCH_BASIC_AUTH_HEADER}'
        ```
        **Sample Request**
        ```
        curl -L -X PUT 'https://localhost:9200/transaction' -H 'Authorization: Basic d3NvMnVzZXI6Y2hhbmdlbWU='
        ```
        **Response**
        ```
        {
        "acknowledged": true,
        "shards_acknowledged": true,
        "index": "transaction"
        }
        ```

## Configure WSO2 Identity Server

Follow the steps below to configure WSO2 IS to communicate with ELK.

1. Login to the management console and create a new user called "Alex"
   with login permission.
2. Navigate to **Service Providers\>List** and click **Edit** on the
   **saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com** service provider.
3. Expand the **Local and Outbound Configuration** section and under **Authentication Type** select
   **Advanced Configuration**.
4. Expand **Script Based Adaptive Authentication**.
5. In the **Templates** tab, under **Analytics** click **ELK-Risk-Based**.
   ![template-for-risk-based-authentication]({{base_path}}/assets/img/elk-analytics/risk-based-adaptive-authentication/risk-based-adaptive-authentication-2.png)

      The resulting authentication script defines a conditional step that executes if the `riskScore` is greater than 0.

6. Click **Update** to save the service provider configurations.

## Try it out

1. Start the Tomcat server and access the following sample PickUp
   application URL:
   <http://localhost.com:8080/saml2-web-app-pickup-dispatch.com> .

2. Log in by giving username and password credentials. You are logged
   in to the application.

    !!! note 
        The user is authenticated with basic authentication only.

3. Log out of the application.

4. Execute the following cURL command. This command publishes an event
   regarding a user bank transaction exceeding $10,000.

    !!! abstract ""
        **Request**
        ```
        curl -L -X POST 'https://{ELASTICSEARCH_HOST}/transaction/_doc' -H 'Authorization: Basic {ELASTICSEARCH_BASIC_AUTH_HEADER}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
        "@timestamp":"{CURRENT_TIMESTAMP}",
        "username":"{USERNAME}",
        "amount": {TRANSACTION_AMOUNT}
        }'
        ```
        **Sample Request**
        ``` 
        curl -L -X POST 'https://localhost:9200/transaction/_doc' -H 'Authorization: Basic d3NvMnVzZXI6Y2hhbmdlbWU=' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-raw '{
        "@timestamp":"{{currenttimestamp}}",
        "username":"Alex",
        "amount": 12000
        }'
        ```
        **Response**
        ```
        {
        "_index": "transaction",
        "_id": "_75YR4EBPqDnJYiU7W_A",
        "_version": 1,
        "result": "created",
        "_shards": {
         "total": 2,
         "successful": 1,
         "failed": 0
        },
        "_seq_no": 0,
        "_primary_term": 1
        }
        ```

5. Log in to the sample PickUp application. You are prompted for the second factor authentication after the basic authentication step.

    !!! info 
        Before executing the cURL command given in step 4, the user had no
        transaction history and the user's riskScore was 0. The
        authentication script is programmed to prompt only basic
        authentication if the risk score is 0.

        After executing the command, a transaction event that indicates the
        user spending more than $10,000 is published and recorded in the
        Siddhi application. Therefore, when the user now attempts to log in
        again, the user's riskScore is evaluated to 1 and the user is
        prompted for an extra step of authentication.
