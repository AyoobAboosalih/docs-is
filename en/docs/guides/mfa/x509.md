## Register a service provider

The next step is to configure the service provider.

1.  Return to the management console.
2.  In the **Service Providers** section under the **Main** tab, click
    **Add**.
3.  Since you are using Travelocity as the sample, enter travelocity.com
    in the **Service Provider Name** text box and click **Register**.
4.  In the **Inbound Authentication Configuration** section, click
    **Configure** under the **SAML2 Web SSO Configuration** section.
5.  Now set the configuration as follows:  
    1.  **Issuer** : travelocity.com
    2.  **Assertion Consumer URL** :
        http://localhost:8080/travelocity.com/home.jsp
6.  Select the following check-boxes:
    1.  **Enable Response Signing**.
    2.  **Enable Single Logout**.
    3.  **Enable Attribute Profile**.
    4.  **Include Attributes in the Response Always**.

7.  Click **Update** to save the changes. Now you will be sent back to
    the **Service Providers** page.
8.  Go to the **Local and Outbound Authentication Configuration**
    section.
9.  You have two options here. You can add X509 certificate
    authenticator as the first factor and also as the second factor.
    
    1.  Second factor  
        1.  Select the **Advanced** configuration radio button option.

        2.  Add the **basic** authentication as a first step and
            **X509Certificate** authentication as the second step.  
            ![first-step-authentication]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/first-step-authentication.png)

    2.  First factor
        -   Select **Local Authentication** as the **Authentication
            Type** and select **X509Certificate** from the drop-down
            list.  
            ![first-factor-x509]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/first-factor-x509.png)
        -   When using X509 as first step authentication, you need to
            create a user in IS management console with the Email
            provided while creating the browser certificate.  
            Example:  
            ![browser-certificate]({{base_path}}/assets/img/learn/browser-certificate.png)

            !!! note
                For more information on creating users and assigning roles
                using management console, refer
                [here]({{base_path}}/learn/configuring-users-roles-and-permissions).
            
10. Finally, click on **Update** to finish the service provider
    configurations.

You have now added and configured the service provider.
